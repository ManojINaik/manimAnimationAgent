1.  **Scene Overview**:
    - Scene story: This scene introduces the reactants needed for photosynthesis, portraying them as the "ingredients" of the process. It sets the stage for explaining how these reactants contribute to the overall reaction.
    - Key takeaway: Photosynthesis requires water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight.
    - Video role: This scene is the second in a series explaining photosynthesis, building upon the introduction and leading into the process explanation.
    - **Visual learning objectives for viewers:**
        - Visualize water absorption through roots as animated `Arrow` objects pointing from soil (`Rectangle` objects) to a root system (`VGroup` of `Line` objects). Display the chemical formula for water (`MathTex`) nearby.
        - Visualize carbon dioxide intake through stomata as animated `Arrow` objects entering a leaf (`Polygon` object). Display the chemical formula for carbon dioxide (`MathTex`) nearby.
        - Visualize sunlight absorption by leaves as animated `Arrow` objects pointing from the sun (`Circle` object) to leaves (`Polygon` object). Display a simplified symbol for sunlight (`MathTex`, e.g., h\nu) nearby.
    - How Manim visuals & animations support learning?
        - The split-screen layout allows for simultaneous presentation of the three reactants.
        - Arrows indicate the direction of movement (absorption/intake).
        - Chemical formulas provide a concise representation of the reactants.
        - Animations make the process more engaging and easier to understand.
        - `VGroup` will be used to group related elements (e.g., root system) for easier manipulation and spacing. Ensure a minimum spacing of 0.3 units between VGroups and other scene elements.
    - Key concepts to emphasize visually:
        - Reactants as "ingredients" for photosynthesis.
        - Water absorption by roots.
        - Carbon dioxide intake by leaves through stomata.
        - Sunlight absorption by leaves.
        - Chemical formulas of the reactants (H2O, CO2, h\nu).

[STORYBOARD]
1.  **Visual Flow & Pacing (Manim Animation Sequence)**:
    - The scene begins with a blank screen, then the three sections (water, carbon dioxide, sunlight) are gradually introduced.
    - Each section will animate to illustrate the absorption or intake process.
    - Chemical formulas will appear near each reactant.
    - The scene will end with all three reactants displayed, emphasizing they are the "ingredients" for photosynthesis.
    - Use `Wait()` commands to pause between sub-scenes and animation steps.
    - **Sub-scene Breakdown**:
        - **Sub-scene 1: Water Absorption**
            - **Visual Element**: Root system absorbing water.
            - **Animation Sequence**:
                1.  Create soil (`Rectangle` objects) at the bottom-left of the screen, within the safe area. Positioned using `.to_corner(DL)` and `.shift(UP*0.5 + RIGHT*0.5)`.
                2.  Create a root system (`VGroup` of `Line` objects) extending from the soil upwards, within the safe area, using `.next_to(soil, UP, buff=0.3)`. Ensure root system is within the left 1/3 of the screen.
                3.  Create animated `Arrow` objects pointing from the soil to the root system, simulating water absorption, using `Create` animation (run_time=1.5). Ensure arrows are within the safe area and maintain 0.3 unit spacing. Use a `VGroup` to manage the arrows.
                4.  Create `MathTex("H_2O")` and position it above the root system, within the safe area, using `.next_to(root_system, UP, buff=0.3)`. Animate using `Write` (run_time=1).
                5.  `Wait(1)`
        - **Sub-scene 2: Carbon Dioxide Intake**
            - **Visual Element**: Leaf with stomata taking in carbon dioxide.
            - **Animation Sequence**:
                1.  Create a leaf (`Polygon` object, roughly triangular) in the middle of the screen, within the safe area. Positioned using `.move_to(ORIGIN)` and `.shift(LEFT*1.5)`.
                2.  Create small openings (stomata, `Circle` objects) on the leaf surface. These circles will be very small and numerous. Ensure stomata are within the safe area and maintain 0.3 unit spacing from each other.
                3.  Create animated `Arrow` objects pointing from the air towards the stomata, simulating carbon dioxide intake, using `Create` animation (run_time=1.5). Ensure arrows are within the safe area and maintain 0.3 unit spacing. Use a `VGroup` to manage the arrows.
                4.  Create `MathTex("CO_2")` and position it above the leaf, within the safe area, using `.next_to(leaf, UP, buff=0.3)`. Animate using `Write` (run_time=1).
                5.  `Wait(1)`
        - **Sub-scene 3: Sunlight Absorption**
            - **Visual Element**: Leaf absorbing sunlight.
            - **Animation Sequence**:
                1.  Create another leaf (`Polygon` object, roughly triangular) on the right side of the screen, within the safe area. Position using `.to_corner(UR)` and `.shift(DOWN*1.5 + LEFT*0.5)`.
                2.  Create a sun (`Circle` object) above the leaf, within the safe area. Position using `.next_to(leaf, UP, buff=2)`.
                3.  Create animated `Arrow` objects pointing from the sun to the leaf, simulating sunlight absorption, using `Create` animation (run_time=1.5). Ensure arrows are within the safe area and maintain 0.3 unit spacing. Use a `VGroup` to manage the arrows.
                4.  Create `MathTex("h\\nu")` and position it above the sun, within the safe area, using `.next_to(sun, UP, buff=0.3)`. Animate using `Write` (run_time=1).
                5.  `Wait(1)`
        - **Sub-scene 4: Emphasize Ingredients**
            - **Visual Element**: All three reactants displayed together.
            - **Animation Sequence**:
                1.  Create a `Tex("Ingredients for Photosynthesis")` and position it at the top center of the screen, within the safe area, using `.to_edge(UP, buff=0.5)`. Animate using `Write` (run_time=2).
                2.  `Wait(2)`
                3.  Fade out the "Ingredients for Photosynthesis" text using `FadeOut` (run_time=1).
                4. `Wait(1)`
