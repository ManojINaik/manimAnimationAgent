3. **Spatial Positioning Strategy**:
    - **Sub-scene 1: Water Absorption**
        - `soil`: `.to_corner(DL)` and `.shift(UP*0.5 + RIGHT*0.5)`. Places the soil in the bottom-left corner, shifted up and right to stay within the safe area.
        - `root_system`: `.next_to(soil, UP, buff=0.3)`. Positions the root system above the soil with a buffer of 0.3 units.
        - `root_line_1`: Start point is on top edge of `soil`, shifted slightly to the left and up. End point is further up and slightly to the left.
        - `root_line_2`: Start point is on top edge of `soil`, directly above center. End point is further up.
        - `root_line_3`: Start point is on top edge of `soil`, shifted slightly to the right and up. End point is further up and slightly to the right.
        - `water_arrows`: Arrows will be created dynamically pointing from the `soil` to the `root_system`.  The starting points will be slightly offset from each other on the soil's top surface. The end points will be near the roots. `.arrange(DOWN, buff=0.3)` will be used if necessary to ensure a minimum spacing of 0.3 units between arrows.
        - `water_formula`: `.next_to(root_system, UP, buff=0.3)`. Positions the water formula above the root system with a buffer of 0.3 units.

    - **Sub-scene 2: Carbon Dioxide Intake**
        - `leaf_1`: `.move_to(ORIGIN)` and `.shift(LEFT*1.5)`. Places the leaf in the middle of the screen, shifted left to stay within safe area.
        - `stomata_1`: `.next_to(leaf_1, UP + RIGHT, buff=0.5)`. Positions a stoma on the upper-right part of the leaf.
        - `stomata_2`: `.next_to(leaf_1, DOWN + LEFT, buff=0.5)`. Positions another stoma on the lower-left part of the leaf.
        - `co2_arrows`: Arrows will be created dynamically pointing from the air towards the `stomata_1` and `stomata_2`. The starting points will be slightly offset from the stomata. `.arrange(DOWN, buff=0.3)` will be used if necessary to ensure a minimum spacing of 0.3 units between arrows.
        - `co2_formula`: `.next_to(leaf_1, UP, buff=0.3)`. Positions the carbon dioxide formula above the leaf with a buffer of 0.3 units.

    - **Sub-scene 3: Sunlight Absorption**
        - `leaf_2`: `.to_corner(UR)` and `.shift(DOWN*1.5 + LEFT*0.5)`. Places the leaf in the upper-right corner, shifted down and left to stay within the safe area.
        - `sun`: `.next_to(leaf_2, UP, buff=2)`. Positions the sun above the leaf with a buffer of 2 units.
        - `sunlight_arrows`: Arrows will be created dynamically pointing from the `sun` to the `leaf_2`. The starting points will be on the bottom edge of the sun. The end points will be on the top surface of the leaf. `.arrange(DOWN, buff=0.3)` will be used if necessary to ensure a minimum spacing of 0.3 units between arrows.
        - `sunlight_formula`: `.next_to(sun, UP, buff=0.3)`. Positions the sunlight formula above the sun with a buffer of 0.3 units.

    - **Sub-scene 4: Emphasize Ingredients**
        - `ingredients_text`: `.to_edge(UP, buff=0.5)`. Places the title text at the top edge of the screen, with a buffer of 0.5 units.

5. **Code Structure & Reusability**:
    - The code is structured into a single `construct` method within the `PhotosynthesisReactants` class.
    - Each sub-scene is clearly separated with comments.
    - For reusability, the leaf creation could be moved to a separate function if needed in other scenes.

***Mandatory Safety Checks***:
    - **Safe Area Enforcement**: All objects are positioned using relative positioning and `shift` commands, ensuring they remain within the safe area. The initial positions are set using `.to_corner()` or `.move_to(ORIGIN)` and then shifted to fine-tune the placement within the safe area. Buffers are used in `next_to` to ensure the objects are within safe area.
    - **Minimum Spacing Validation**: A `buff` value of 0.3 units is used in the `next_to` method to maintain a minimum spacing of 0.3 units between objects. The `arrange` method, if used, ensures that the arrows are spaced out appropriately. Spacing within the VGroups is implicitly handled.
    - **Transition Buffers**: `Wait()` calls are used between animation steps and sub-scenes to create transition buffers.
