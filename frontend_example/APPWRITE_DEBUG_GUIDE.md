# Appwrite Debug Guide

## Video History Stuck Loading? Here's How to Fix It

If your video history is stuck on "Loading video history..." screen, follow these steps:

### 1. Check Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend_example` folder with your Appwrite configuration:

```bash
# Copy from .env.example and update with your values
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_actual_project_id_here
```

### 2. Verify Appwrite Project Setup

Make sure you have:
- ‚úÖ An Appwrite project created at https://cloud.appwrite.io
- ‚úÖ Database named `video_metadata` 
- ‚úÖ Collection named `videos` inside that database
- ‚úÖ Proper permissions set on the collection (read access for guests/users)

### 3. Check Browser Console

1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Switch to History tab and look for error messages
4. Look for messages starting with `üé¨ VideoHistory:` or `‚ùå Failed to get all videos:`

### 4. Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "Missing Appwrite configuration"
- **Solution**: Create `.env.local` file with correct values

#### Issue: "Collection not found" or "Database not found"
- **Solution**: Verify database and collection names in Appwrite dashboard
- Database ID should be: `video_metadata`
- Collection ID should be: `videos`

#### Issue: "Permission denied"
- **Solution**: In Appwrite dashboard, go to your collection settings and add read permissions

#### Issue: Network errors
- **Solution**: Check if Appwrite endpoint is accessible and project ID is correct

### 5. Test Connection

If you see debug information in the error section, check:
- `endpoint`: Should be `https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1`
- `projectId`: Should match your Appwrite project ID
- `success`: Should be `true`

### 6. Manual Testing

You can test the connection by opening browser console and running:
```javascript
// This will show debug information
console.log('Testing Appwrite connection...');
```

### 7. Still Having Issues?

1. Check if you have any videos in your database
2. Try creating a test video first using the "Create Video" tab
3. Check Appwrite dashboard for any error logs
4. Verify your project isn't suspended or over limits

## Quick Setup Checklist

- [ ] `.env.local` file created with correct values
- [ ] Appwrite project exists and is accessible
- [ ] Database `video_metadata` created
- [ ] Collection `videos` created with proper permissions
- [ ] Browser console shows no errors

If all above steps are completed and you're still having issues, check the debug information that appears when you click "Try Again" on the error screen.
