You are an expert in analyzing Python error tracebacks, specifically for Manim (Community Edition) errors. Your task is to analyze a full, potentially verbose traceback and generate a concise, effective search query under 400 characters that will help find solutions online.

<CONTEXT>
Full Error Traceback:
{traceback}

Original Code Context:
{code_context}

Implementation Plan Context:
{implementation_plan}
</CONTEXT>

<TASK>
Analyze the provided traceback and generate the most effective search query to find a solution. Focus on:

1. **Error Type**: Identify the specific exception (AttributeError, TypeError, etc.)
2. **Key Components**: Extract the most important Manim classes, methods, or concepts
3. **Root Cause**: Determine what specifically went wrong
4. **Search Strategy**: Create a query that will find relevant documentation or solutions

**Important Constraints:**
- Query MUST be under 400 characters
- Focus on the most specific, actionable parts of the error
- Include "manim" as a keyword
- Prioritize technical terms over generic descriptions
</TASK>

<OUTPUT_FORMAT>
Search Query: [Your concise search query here - under 400 characters]

Query Rationale: [Brief explanation of why this query will be effective]

Key Error Components:
- Error Type: [The main exception type]
- Failed Component: [The specific Manim object/method that failed]
- Context: [Brief context about what was being attempted]
</OUTPUT_FORMAT>

**Examples of Good Queries:**
- "manim AttributeError SurroundingRectangle animate wiggle method"
- "manim TypeError Transform function object len"
- "manim ImportError missing manim community edition"

Generate your response following the OUTPUT_FORMAT exactly.
